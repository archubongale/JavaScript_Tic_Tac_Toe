***Tic tac toe game for two players***

Demonstration of constructors and prototypes using JavaScript to create a Tic Tac Toe game for two players.

**By Archana Bongale**

**Description**

Consider making four constructors/prototypes: Player, Space, Board, and Game. The objects created from these could include some of the following features:

A player should know whether it's an X or an O.
A space should know its coordinates and be able to be marked by a player (e.g., space.markby(playerX)).
A board should create 9 spaces with the proper coordinates, and tell if there are three in a row marked by the same player. A board should be able to return a space by its coordinates (e.g., board.find(1, 2)).
A game should create 2 players and a board, be able to move to the next turn, know which player's turn it is, and be able to tell if the game is over or not.
